<chapter>Burgan Vale</chapter>?
The people of Burgan Vale treat the Veil, the energies which bind the land and the people together, as the centerpiece for every aspect of life. They are not dissuaded by its chaotic side-effects, but instead train intensely to master them, reaching great heights of prowess in channeling and spellcraft. They have concern that others not abuse its power and ruin the scarce sources of mana in the wilds.?
To this end, they have created The Order of the Eye, a group of channelers who monitor the use of magic in the Realm through sorceries and subterfuge. Initiates of the Order wear blue robes, as a symbol of their station.?
Part of becoming a powerful channeler is living with less, and this is reflected in the Spartan dwellings the people of Burgan Vale maintain. They are simple wooden structures, functional and clean in design, with not much flourish. The only opulent structure is Arankh, a large tower which raises high above all the other structures in the valley. It is a repository of knowledge, unparalleled in scope and detail.?
The people of Burgan Vale tend to be reserved in speech and manner, but do succumb to wild abandon during the Festival of Illusions, their summer celebration of the power of sorcerous craft. The night sky lights up in an almost cataclysmic explosion of color, a fitting backdrop to days of spirited competition and debate.

Before anyone inhabited the Vale, there stood a solitary gray tower at the base of massive granite cliffs. No life existed around the tower, no birds flew and no trees grew. Those who found a way inside the tower spoke of a sad man living within, withered and cold, immune to death. The people of Burgan Vale called him the Gray Recluse, and came to understand that if left alone, he posed no threat. When treated aggressively, he turned all those that dared confront him into mindless golems of flesh.?
Thedda was the greatest channeler ever to live within Burgan Vale. Such was her power that she could pull mana from barren earth and detect eddies in the veil from the casting of spells miles away. The Gray Recluse, fearing she might learn his secrets, walked out into a night lit by the full moon and stole her away to his tower. But Thedda saw this before it happened, and put all of her knowledge and spirit in a book made of hatchling dragonskin vellum. These pages she covered with mundane writings on star orbits in order to conceal the book until such time as it could be recovered by the people of the Vale.?
Marellus and Elisa found evidence Thedda left behind of the existence of this book, and are willing to share its location if they think the heroes will use it for aims they support.?
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>?
The Gray Recluse is mostly unconcerned about the threat the heroes pose. He is usually happy to entertain guests, at least until he bores of their presence or they make a misstep.?
<list>
Overcome foreboding on the Trail of Fireflies.?
Align the looking glass in the Chamber of Astromancy.?
Open the first vault by capturing the light of the North Star.?

<h2>Resolution</h2>?
