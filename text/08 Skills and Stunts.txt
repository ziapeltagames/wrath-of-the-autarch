<chapter>Skills and Stunts</chapter>
Most actions taken by players during the game involve the use of skills and stunts. Typically, when the dice are rolled as part of an action, the result is added to an appropriate skill and compared against the opposition. Stunts provide additional effects that can modify how skills are used or provide special effects during different types of conflicts.
<h1>Skills</h1>
Skills in <book>Wrath of the Autarch</book> are fairly broad descriptions of capabilities and areas of expertise. Skills are used in conjunction with the four core actions mentioned in the <chapref>Fate</chapref> chapter. Some skills are more suited to certain core actions than others (for instance, <skill>Survival</skill> isn't used for Attacks). Every skill can be used with the Create Advantage.
The four types of conflicts tend to focus on distinct skills. For instance, Tactics is very useful in Warfare, while Stealth is most useful during Infiltration. Knowing which skills are best for each conflict is useful when determining which heroes to take on a mission. The skill description also describes what sorts of conflicts a skill is best suited for.
<h1>Stunts</h1>
Stunts are special applications of skills, accessible when a skill reaches a certain level. They allow for additional bonuses to rolls, special benefits during certain conflicts, or other advantages that go beyond the normal usages of a skill.
<h2>Gaining Stunts</h2>
Heroes start the campaign with one stunt for their skill of rank Great (+4). Each time a skill advances to the rank of Superb (+5) or higher, the hero gains one additional stunt from that skill’s stunt list. Some stunts have other stunts listed as prerequisites. In that case, the stunt is not available until the character also has all the listed prerequisite stunts.
<h2>Opposition Stunts</h2>
Some stunts are only available to the opposition the heroes face (opposing leaders, monsters, and minions). These stunts are listed with the Opposition tag and are not available for heroes to take. Some opposition stunts take more than one slot for purposes of the total number of stunts. For instance, if a leader is allowed to take three stunts, and one of them takes two slots, they are only allowed one more stunt. There is a general opposition stunts section for opposition stunts which don’t map to any particular skill.
<h1>Athletics</h1>
Athletics encompasses not just physical fitness, but also body awareness and movement.  It is used for climbing, swimming, tumbling, and balancing.  If all that matters is raw power, and not some form of movement, then Physique is the more relevant skill.
Athletics determines the maximum number of zones a character can move in skirmish and infiltration conflicts. When unopposed, no roll is needed to move the maximum number of zones.
<list>
<b>Athletics 0-2: </b>2 zones
<b>Athletics 3-5: </b>3 zones
<b>Athletics 6+: </b>4 zones
</list>
<stuntt>Tumbling</stuntt>

<stuntd>When Defending against a Fighting attack with Athletics, may move one zone away after the attack.</stuntd>
<stuntt>Shifty Dodge (Improved)</stuntt>
<stuntp>Infiltration, Skirmish, Prerequisite: Shifty Dodge</stuntp>
<stuntd>When Defending against a Fighting attack with Athletics, may move two zones away after the attack.</stuntd>

<stuntp>Infiltration, Skirmish, Prerequisite: Tumbling</stuntp>
<stuntd>May move two zones and still take a free action.</stuntd>
<h1>Channeling</h1>
Channeling is used to detect and harness the magic energies that can be found in the wildest regions of the Realm. Channeling is also used to determine the amount of starting mana a spellcaster has available to them. See the <chapref>Magic</chapref> chapter for more details on mana, spellcasting, and channeling.
If a character takes any of the following stunts which require the spending of mana, the character should bind to a region as a spellcaster (no changes if already bound to a region). After any expenditure of mana, determine backlash as normal.
<stuntt>Arcane Defense</stuntt>
<stuntd>For each mana spent, add +1 to any character’s Defend action against arcane attacks (actions which require the use mana).</stuntd>
<stuntt>Chaotic Reserves</stuntt>
<stuntd>For each mana spent, take one physical stress and add +1 to any character’s Attack action which causes physical stress.</stuntd>
<stuntt>Hurt the Ones You Love</stuntt>
<stuntd>When this character generates backlash, it may be reduced by four. If reduced, choose a target character from the same faction as the caster. For heroes, the target character is the one the hero has a helpful aspect with. The target character takes a severe consequence. If the target character doesn't have an open severe consequence slot, they are killed instead. The consequence should be thematically appropriate to the type of magic used.</stuntd>
<stuntt>Fleeting Familiar</stuntt>
<stuntd>Summon a magical entity to perform tasks. Spend three mana and add +3 to a Create Advantage action using Channeling. Create an aspect to describe a specialized arcane familiar or the result of using the familiar.</stuntd>
