NOTES: What should be in a skill description? Should there be a breakdown
of the core actions? How the skill relates to the different Conflicts?
For now, describe the skill and the stunts, leaving the other pieces out.
Having those other pieces is probably a good addition.

Should stunts have some sort of standardization?
Should stunts be limited to conflict types, etc?
