<chapter>Seasons</chapter>
The campaign for <book>Wrath of the Autarch</book> is organized by seasons, which represent about three months within the game. A season is designed to take roughly three hours to play through, making it a good length of time for the typical session. The main focus for each season is the mission. Missions are covered in the next chapter. In addition to the mission, a season also includes gathering and trading resources, building developments, and determining new threats.
The term <i>season</i> is used loosely. A mission may take more or less time than three months. Missions may overlap somewhat. Although the players undertake only one mission each season, it’s assumed that many activities are going on within the Stronghold, such as researching developments, but these activities don’t need detailed narration. The constraint of one mission per season keeps the pace of the game moving forward and focuses on the big picture. It also makes for difficult choices in terms of allocating scarce resources.
This chapter details the upkeep and development of the Stronghold. It also lists the steps that book-end a mission. The details of mission structure, as well as the sorts of missions available and what they do for the Stronghold, are covered in the next chapter.
<h1>Spotlight Player</h1>
Each session, one player is chosen as the <term>spotlight player</term>. This player has the final say on any choices for the season, such as what developments to build, what mission to undertake, which heroes are chosen. Even more important than resolving disagreements, which probably aren’t that common, the spotlight player has a larger role in the events of the session. As much as possible, the responsibility of spotlight player should rotate among all the players throughout the campaign.
<h2>Modify Relationships</h2>
If desired, the Stronghold player may modify the helpful or hindering relationships for the hero they’ve chosen for the mission. They should narrate what prompted this change.
<h1>Faction Growth</h1>
At the start of each year (prior to each Spring season), there may be stability increases for the factions. The cards are shuffled, and one card is drawn for each faction (including the Empire). If the result is +2 or higher, the faction gains one stability. See <chapref>Factions</chapref> (page XX) for more details on stability.
<h1>Ignored Threats and Schemes</h1>
Before gaining resources, the penalties for ignored threats (page XX) are applied to the Stronghold. Note that using a development to deal with a threat isn’t the same as ignoring it (if a development is used, it’s like the threat never happened).
<h2>Regional Threats</h2>
Ignored regional threats make it impossible to gather resources from the region. Ignore that region when calculating resource totals. Furthermore, ignoring a region threat causes the Stronghold to lose one stability.
<h2>Faction Threats</h2>
The result of ignoring a faction threat is different if the faction is an ally (they have a disposition of -1 or higher) or an enemy (they have a disposition of -2 or lower). If an ally faction threat is ignored, lose one disposition with the faction and no trade with that faction is possible this season. If the faction is an enemy faction, one disposition is lost and the Stronghold loses one stability.
<h2>Autarch Schemes</h2>
There are various Autarch schemes available to the Autarch player. They have different effects if ignored. See <chapref>Threats</chapref> (page XX) for more details.
<h1>Stronghold Upkeep</h1>
During <term>Stronghold upkeep</term>, the spotlight player gathers resources, trades, builds developments, and feeds the populace. Optionally, they may hold a festival or stage a prison break. Lay out the chronicle of trade and the five tech trees found at the end of the book.
<h2>Gather Resources</h2>
The first step during Stronghold upkeep is to add up all the <term>resources</term> for regions controlled by the Stronghold. These should be tracked on the Stronghold sheet, but might be modified based on regional threats or other effects. Gather one six-sided die (d6) for each resource, using different colored dice for each resource type (for example, three green d6 could be used for 3 timber).
After gathering the appropriate dice, they’re all rolled. All purchases (developments, feeding the populace, festivals, etc.) during the Stronghold upkeep phase must be made using whole dice. Any leftover amount on the dice isn’t used (if something costs 6 timber, and there are only two timber dice showing 5 and 3, both dice must be allocated to meet the cost).
<h3>Build Developments</h3>
The main use of resource dice is to build <term>developments</term>. Each development requires a certain amount of resources to complete. In addition, most developments have other developments as prerequisites. All prerequisite developments must be built first. See <chapref>Developments</chapref> (page XX) for more details.

Any number of developments may be built in a season provided that all the resource costs are met. The benefits of developments take effect immediately. Since ignored threats have already been applied, it’s too late to use a just purchased development to stop a threat.
<h3>Mustering Units</h3>
<term>Units</term> are built at the same time. Purchasing units follows the same process, and each unit works like a separate development. The same rule about whole dice applies to each such unit created.
<example>Jeremy is the spotlight player. He wishes to muster infantry units, which cost 6 food each. Jeremy has food dice with values 6, 5, 5, and 3. At most, 2 infantry may be mustered. The 6 die musters the first infantry; two of the remaining dice must be used together to muster a second infantry, leaving a third die which may be used for something else.</example>
<h3>Trade</h3>
The <term>faction sheet</term> lists the benefits of trade with other factions, based on current disposition. Each faction may only be traded with once each season. Trading is done by taking the dice desired by the faction from the seasonal total and placing them on the faction’s entry on the chronicle of trade sheet. Next, the listed amount of dice are taken from the supply and rolled. These dice are then added to the seasonal total. Any trade rate at or below the current disposition may be used, but only one such trade is allowed each season. Remember that ignored ally threats prohibit trade with the faction this season.
<diagram>Show a snippet of trade section of the faction sheet for this example.</diagram>
<example>Example: The Stronghold’s disposition with Gravewood is at 3. The spotlight player could either trade 2 luxury dice for 5 timber dice (rolling the timber dice immediately) or take the lesser trade of 1 luxury die for 2 timber dice (again, rolling them immediately). If either option is taken, no more trading is possible with Gravewood for the remainder of the season. Placing the luxury dice onto the Gravewood box on the faction sheet is a good way to remember which factions have been traded with.</example>
<h3>Luxuries</h3>
Luxuries provide an additional benefit: a luxury die can be discarded to reroll any dice of one resource type. A luxury die used in this fashion is removed from the gathered resources for the season and can’t be used for anything else.
<example>Example: Jeremy rolls 4 timber dice for the season, resulting in 6, 2, 2, and 1. Not great! He decides to use one luxury die to reroll the three timber dice with low results. He rerolls the 2, 2, and 1 dice, resulting in 5, 5, and 2! Much better! The luxury die is discarded.</example>
<h3>Feed the Populace</h3>
Besides building developments, the population must be fed. This requires twice as much food as the Stronghold has regions (for example, 12 food is needed if the Stronghold has six regions). Note that this is total food (the value on the dice), not the number of food dice. The same rule applies that whole dice must be allocated, however.
If there’s less food available than twice the number of regions, the stability of the Stronghold drops by one. If there’s less food than the number of regions, stability instead drops by two. This is summarized on the chronicle of trade.
If desired, the Stronghold players may purposefully not fully feed the population in order to have extra food to invest for other uses. This option can only be taken if the Stronghold actually has stability to lose (stability is above -6).
<h3>Festivals</h3>
Festivals may be held at a price that’s equal to the number of regions in luxuries. Similar to feeding the population, this is the total value on luxury dice, not the number of dice. Spending luxuries in such a way increases stability by one.
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
A hero may be rescued from imprisonment by assigning heroes to break them out. These heroes may not go on the mission for the season. To see if they were successful, draw a card and add the highest Thievery skill of all heroes present. Any helping heroes also assigned to the break out may add one to the result provided they have a Thievery skill of one or higher. If this result is equal to or higher than the infiltration difficulty (page XX) of the faction that captured them, the hero is rescued and may be used in the future. The result may not be modified with free invokes or fate points.
<h1>Mission</h1>
After Stronghold upkeep, the chosen mission is played through. The <chapref>Missions</chapref> chapter contains details on how missions are structured as well as the different sorts of missions available. The steps that must be taken before and after the mission are covered here.
<h2>Choose Heroes</h2>
The first step before going on a mission is to choose heroes. The spotlight player chooses first. Think about the suitability of the different heroes for the mission at hand. This is mostly determined by the skills of the heroes and the type of conflict the mission uses. The list below summarizes which skills are most useful for each conflict, although different sorts of magic (via Lore stunts) can substitute for these skills.
<list>
<b>Diplomacy—</b>Rapport, Society, Wits
<b>Infiltration—</b>Athletics, Disguise, Stealth, Thievery
<b>Skirmish—</b>Athletics, Fighting, Marksmanship, Survival
<b>Warfare—</b>Command, Engineering, Tactics
</list>
<h2>Training and Recovery</h2>
Before going on the mission, heroes may be able to recover consequences and train skills. On the top of the character sheet is the last season the hero went on a mission. For each season of downtime between then and the current season (each open checkbox), the hero may add an advance to one skill (mark one of the three boxes next to a skill on the character sheet) <b>and</b> make one season of progress towards removing a consequences.
Major and minor consequences take one season to resolve, while severe consequences take two seasons.
<example>Fuscus was last on a mission six seasons ago (it’s Spring of Year 4, and Summer of Year 2 was his last mission), which means there were five seasons of downtime that Fuscus could train and recover consequences. Fuscus has both a major and a severe consequence. The severe consequence has one check of progress. Fuscus removes both the major and severe consequence (requiring two seasons of downtime) and marks five skill advances.</example>
Finally, update the last mission date to the current season on the top of the character sheet.
<h3>Advance Skills</h3>
After any training is done, any skills that have three advances (whether through training or from a mission) may be raised by one. However, there’s a restriction that every skill must have at least one skill in the rank below it. For instance, if a character has a Superb (+5) Fighting skill that has three advances, and no other Superb skills, the player may not advance it, since that would leave a Fantastic (+6) Fighting skill with no Superb (+5) skills in the rank directly below. This prevents advancing one skill up the ladder without taking at least a few others along the way.
If a skill is increased by one rank, erase all the advances. Skills advancing to the rank of Superb (+5) or higher gain the hero one additional stunt from the skill’s stunt list. See <chapref>Skills and Stunts</chapref> (page XX) for more details on stunts.
<h2>Starting Fate Points</h2>
Each Stronghold player starts the mission with two fate points. Starting fate points are modified by the Stronghold stability. If stability is -3 or -4, each player starts with one; if it’s -5 or -6, each player starts with none!
However, if Stronghold stability is +3 or +4, each player starts with three fate points; if it’s +5 or +6 each player starts with four. The spotlight player may get extra fate points from setting aside resource dice during the spending of resources (gain one fate point for every two dice). A maximum of two additional fate points may be gained for the spotlight player in such a manner.
<h2>Refresh Consequence Free Invokes</h2>
If a hero has any consequences, the free invokes for those consequences are reset if they’re filled in. Remove any check marks showing that the free invokes for the consequences have been taken. The Autarch player may freely invoke consequences each season on heroes. Consequences are the gift that keeps on giving!
<h2>Play Mission</h2>
The main part of a season consists of playing through the chosen mission. Playing through the challenge phase and the conflict is described in <chapref>Missions</chapref> (page XX).
<h2>Advance and Recover</h2>
Each hero that went on the mission may take one skill advance in any desired skill. Additionally they may mark one season of progress on a consequence box. This works the same as it does during downtime training (page XX).
<h2>Remove Stress</h2>
After the mission is over, all stress is removed. Consequences hang around and must be removed via downtime.
<h2>Mission Results</h2>
Every mission has repercussions for the Stronghold. The Stronghold sheet and chronicle of trade are updated to reflect these changes at the conclusion of the mission. Notes may be made on the <term>chronicle of seasons</term> in order to remember important details, such as stability or region loss, or notable consequences taken by important characters. The details of how to resolve each type of mission are given in <chapref>Missions</chapref> (page XX) and the different conflict chapters.
For threats, it’s important to note that failing a threat is different than ignoring a threat. The repercussions for ignoring a threat were applied earlier before Stronghold upkeep. Usually, failing a threat isn’t as bad as ignoring it completely.
<h1>Determine New Threats and Schemes</h1>
After the mission is over, the spotlight player checks for region threats and ally threats. The Autarch player decides if they would like to reveal a scheme. The differences between threats and schemes are described in more detail in <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> (page XX). Note that none of the checks to see if a threat occurs are skill checks, so fate points may not be spent to alter them. Before checking for threats, reshuffle all of the cards.
<h2>Region Threats</h2>
Region threats are disruptions and problems with a region the Stronghold controls, potentially causing issues with gathering resources as well as draining Stronghold stability. For each region the Stronghold controls, draw a card (or roll the dice). If the result is +3 or +4, there’s a threat in the region. To determine the details of the region threat, including difficulty and the type of conflict needed to resolve it, roll on the Region Threats chart (page XX).
<h2>Faction Threats</h2>
Faction threats are potential sources of strife from factions. Ignoring them lowers the disposition of the minor faction, damaging the relationship. For each minor faction, draw a card (or roll the dice). If the result is a +3 or +4, there’s a faction threat with that minor faction.
If the faction is an ally (they have a disposition of -1 or higher), check on the Faction Threats chart (page XX) to determine the difficulty and type of conflict needed to resolve it. If the faction is an enemy (-2 disposition or lower), the Autarch player chooses the type of conflict.
<h2>Autarch Schemes</h2>
Each year, the Autarch player may reveal two schemes. At this time, the Autarch player decides if they would like to use a scheme, and if so, which track to advance.
See <chapref>Threats and Schemes</chapref> (page XX) for available options. If a scheme is chosen, update the chronicle of trade to show the current Empire mission difficulties and scheme levels.
<h1>Next Mission</h1>
The final activity of the season is planning what mission should be undertaken next. The spotlight player resolves any disagreements. If this is done at the end of the evening, it helps the group plan for next session. It may also be useful to resolve over e-mail or some other medium to allow for more involved discussions.
