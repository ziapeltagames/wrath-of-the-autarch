<chapter>Developments</chapter>
Developments are cultural, technological, and civic improvements to the Stronghold. Developments might be physical structures like a mage tower, scientific advancements such as gunpowder, or even skilled groups of people, like diplomats.
Developments may affect the Stronghold directly, for example, by improving defensive capabilities, or developments might affect the heroes, giving them situational benefits during play. The latter sorts of developments are like stunts, except they affect all heroes from the Stronghold, not just one.
The Stronghold players build developments by spending the resources they obtain, as detailed in the <chapref>Seasons</chapref> chapter.
Other factions don’t have developments (with the exception of Keeps and Castles). Instead, these are abstracted away into general difficulties for each of the four types of conflict.
<h1>Anatomy of a Development</h1>
Developments are described by the resource costs for building them (food, timber, ore, luxuries, and mana), by the tech tree they belong to, and by their effect.
<h2>Regional Developments</h2>
Keeps and castles are very closely related to a particular region. When these developments are built, they should be listed on the Stronghold sheet under a particular region where they will reside. Factions already have these developments listed in the regions they control. Regional developments allow duplicates to be built, with a maximum of one such development in each region. If a region containing a development is ever lost for some reason, the development is lost with it. If a region has a threat which prevents any production of goods, the development will also no longer function until the threat conditions are removed.
<h2>Tech Trees</h2>
The developments are divided into five tech trees. There is one tech tree for each type of conflict (diplomacy, infiltration, skirmish, and warfare) as well as a tech tree for arcane developments. The four conflict tech trees have effects which mainly help in each of those four conflict types, while the developments in the arcane tech tree benefit spellcaster heroes. The better developments in each tech tree have prerequisite developments in the tech tree which must be built first. The peak developments in each tree are difficult to obtain, and it will only be possible to at most build a few of them over the course of the campaign.?
<h2>Defensive Developments</h2>?
Some developments give the Stronghold certain defensive capabilities to cancel threats. Each such development may only be used once each year. There is space on the Developments Summary sheet to track whether these have been used or not.?
