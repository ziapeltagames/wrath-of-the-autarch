        <chapter>Skills and Stunts</chapter> 
        <p1>Most actions taken by players involve skills and stunts. Typically, when the dice are rolled as part of an action, the result is added to an appropriate skill and compared against the opposition. Stunts provide additional effects that can modify how skills are used or provide special effects during different types of Conflicts.</p1>  
        <h1>Skills</h1> 
        <p1>Due to its Fate lineage, skills in <book>Wrath of the Autarch</book> are fairly broad descriptions of capabilities and areas of expertise. Skills are used in conjunction with the four core actions mentioned in the <chapref>Fate</chapref> chapter. Some skills are more suited to certain core actions than others (for instance, <skill>Science</skill> isn&apos;t usually used to Attack with). Every skill can be used with the Create Advantage and Overcome actions.</p1> 
        <p1>Since the only action types available in the Challenge Phase are Create an Advantage and Overcome, every skill could play a role in the Challenge Phase. The four types of Conflicts tend to focus on distinct skills. For instance, Tactics is very useful in Warfare, while Stealth is most useful during Infiltration. Knowing which skills are best for each Conflict is useful when determining which heroes to take on a mission. The skill description also describes what sorts of Conflicts a skill is best suited for.</p1> 
        <h1>Stunts</h1> 
        <p1>Stunts are special applications of skills, accessible when a skill reaches a certain level. They allow for additional bonuses to rolls, special benefits during certain Conflicts, or other advantages that go beyond the normal usages of a skill.</p1> 
        <h2>Gaining Stunts</h2> 
        <p1>When a skill reaches the rank of Great (+4), the player picks one of the stunts listed under the skill description and writes it on their character sheet. For each skill rank above Great (+4), the character gains one additional stunt. Some stunts have other stunts listed as preqrequisites. In that case, the stunt is not available until the character also has all the listed prerequisite stunts.</p1> 
        <p1>Since characters begin play with one skill at the rank of Great (+4), they also get one stunt from that skill.</p1>
        <h1>Athletics</h1> 
        <p1>Athletics encompasses not just physical fitness, but also body awareness and movement.  It is used for climbing, swimming, tumbling, and balancing.  If all that matters is raw power, and not some form of movement, then Physique is the more relevant skill.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Careful Movement</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Step down the hinder die on any movement rolls.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Excellent Climber</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Step up the help die on any rolls involving climbing.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Shifty Dodge</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>In a Skirmish, when using Athletics to defend against a Fighting attack, may move one zone away after the attack.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Roll with the Blow</stuntt> 
        <stuntp>Prerequisite: Shifty Dodge</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>In a Skirmish, when using Athletics to defend against a Fighting attack, may move two zones away after the attack</stuntd>  
        <h1>Channeling</h1> 
        <p1>Channeling is used to detect and harness the magic energies that can be found in the wildest regions of the Realm. Channeling is also used to determine the amount of starting mana a spellcaster has available to them. See the <chapref>Magic</chapref> chapter for more details on mana, spellcasting, and channeling.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Chaotic Reserves</stuntt>
        <stuntd>Bind to a Region and gain mana each season as a spellcaster (no changes if already a spellcaster). Spend one and only one mana on any roll to step up both the help and hinder die by one. No backlash with this ability.</stuntd>
        <stuntt>Land Give Me Strength</stuntt>
        <stuntd>Bind to a Region as a spellcaster. Destroy one resource from the bound region to step up the help die on any roll by two.</stuntd>
        <stuntt>Hurt the Ones You Love</stuntt>
        <stuntd>Reduce the amount of backlash rolled by six. In exchange, a character from the same faction as the caster must take a severe consequence. The character should be someone the caster cares about (the caster should have a relevant relationship aspect with the character who takes the consequence). If the target character doesn't have an open severe consequence slot, they are killed instead. The consequence should be thematically appropriate to the type of magic used.</stuntd>   
        <stuntt>The Land Weeps for My Pain</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Bind to a Region as a spellcaster. Reduce the stress taken from any attack by one for each resource sacrificed from the land the character is bound to. Resources lost this way may not be recovered.</stuntd>              
        <h1>Deceive</h1> 
        <p1>Disguises, bluffing, and gambling are all practical applications of the Deceive skill. Any time lies are involved, the Deceive skill usually comes into play.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Blackmail Artist</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Step up the help die on social rolls when the character is blackmailing the target.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Deep Cover</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>If captured during an Infiltration mission, the character may successfully shift blame to some other faction. Add a relevant permanent aspect to the target faction, indicating their growing distrust and animosity. Although the Stronghold takes no disposition hits, the caught character suffers all normal penalties (they could be detained or executed).</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>Trained Actor</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Step up the help die when the character pretends to be someone they aren’t.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>With Friends like These…</stuntt>

        <stuntd>However, on a failed roll, change the relationship aspect to something negative.</stuntd>         
        <h1>Empathy</h1> 
        <p1>Empathy is the ability to read another person&apos;s feelings. This is typically used to detect how honest another person is being, as well as getting a handle on their emotional state.</p1> 
        <stuntt>I Know a Bad Deal When I Hear It</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Step up the help die on any rolls for recognizing a bad deal.</stuntd> 
        <stuntt>I’ve Sized You Up</stuntt>

        <stuntd>Step up the help die when defending against being seduced.</stuntd>                
        <h1>Fighting</h1> 
        <p1>Fighting is knowledge of weapons and the ability to utilize them to defeat others in martial combat. It also covers unarmed combat. However, it isn’t used for leading units of many men into battle, which falls under the Tactics skill.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Favored Weapon</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>The character has extensive training with a particular weapon. Replace one of the character's aspects with an aspect describing their favored weapon (if they don't already have one). Step up the help die when using the favored weapon in combat.</stuntd>

        <stuntp>Requirement:  Favored Weapon</stuntp> 
        <stuntd>Step up the help die when using the favored weapon in combat.</stuntd>

        <p1>Investigation is the ability to corroborate evidence and interpret and analyze clues. A character with a high Investigation skill also knows who to talk to or where to go next.</p1>

        <h1>Intimidation</h1> 
        <p1>Where Rapport is the act of building long term friendships and making friends, Intimidation is about getting what you want through more direct means. This isn’t usually the basis for a healthy relationship, but can be very effective motivator in the short term.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Battlefield Savagery</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>You perform a vicious and disturbing attack. Spend a fate point to add your Intimidation value to Fighting. However, the target may mitigate the stress through using both the physical and mental stress tracks.</stuntd>

        <stuntd>Step up the help die when using Create Advantage related to your looks.</stuntd> 
        <h1>Leadership</h1> 
        <p1>The Leadership skill is used to get the most out of people. A character with a high Leadership is listened to and respected, if not always liked.</p1>

        <p1>Lore is knowledge of the mystical and arcane facets of the Realm. Knowledge of spells, artifacts, and bizarre creatures of myth. Lore is also essential to learning Secrets, the harnessing of mana to produce magical effects.</p1> 
        <stuntt>Initiate</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>The character chooses a Secret and gains access to the Initiate spell from that Secret. Choose a region to bind with, and gain mana each season from the region. See the <chapref>Magic</chapref> chapter for more details.</stuntd>

        <stuntt>Animal Companion (Good)</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>Create an animal companion with two skills of rank 3, a minor consequence of, and an aspect. These skills, consequences, and aspects function almost identically to those for your character. However, the animal’s skills can never be improved.  The animal’s skills may be used instead of your character’s skills, and the consequence may be taken by your animal companion instead of your character, as thematically appropriate. This functions as a minion. See the <chapref>Characters</chapref> chapter for more details.</stuntd>

        <p1>Where Athletics governs pure physical power, Physique is used to measure raw physical power and endurance.

        <stuntt>Battle Master</stuntt> 
        <stuntd>During Warfare, spend a fate point to order one unit to complete a specific objective. The unit no longer needs to remain in the same zone as the leader, and may be controlled independently for the duration of the battle.</stuntd>

        </ul>
        <h1>Designer’s Notes</h1> 
        <p1>It would be nice to have a generic set of actions available to use to describe skills, as shown in Fate Core. Would it be useful to have descriptions of the core actions for the skills, as well as the various ways they’re used in mini-games?</p1> 
        <p1>The issue is that the four core actions of Fate Core don’t really align to the different types of scenes. Two of them (create advantage and overcome) seem universal, but attack/defend isn’t related to most of the mini-games. It’s thus probably necessary to add trappings to skills based on the mini-games, rather than those core actions.</p1>
