<chapter>The Sunriders</chapter>
The Sunriders philosophy is simple: roam free on the plains. This drives most of their life, from their transient dwellings to their ability to rapidly mobilize and advance against an enemy.
The only elaborate and permanent dwellings are large structures to support the many farms, such as mills and tanneries. These are guarded by smaller garrisons inhabited by a mix of newly minted fighters and troops recently retired from the front lines. Defense isn’t a great concern of the Sunriders, since the vast tracts of land are so difficult to traverse.
Horses make up a centerpiece of daily life. Huge, powerful destriers, from which the Sunriders get their name, are jealously protected and bred for use in battle and transport. Learning to ride and command them is started at a young age.
There is only one leader, Arban the Swift, unquestionably the strongest and most powerful in battle. He delegates authority to a number of generals he trusts. Leadership changes tend to be bloody affairs for the Sunriders, as one group extends out and eliminates another.
Magic is an obsession for the Sunriders. They have a great interest in harnessing mana from the land, but besides lacking expertise, the lands they control are largely devoid of the magical energies found elsewhere.

Ile has accepted her tragic lot in life, and now looks to carve out a niche for herself within the Sunriders clan. She understands the arcane world better than most of the Sunriders.
<h1>Diplomacy</h1>
The Sunriders live a hard life revolving around their steeds, livestock, hunting, and war. They don’t have much patience for people who can’t hold their own in a fight. Ultimately, Arban decides the fate of the Sunriders. However, Hogel has great influence over what course of action Arban will take.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 4
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>

Help Ile harness mana from Song Bluff.
Repel Moonrider bandits.
Discuss future military strategy with Taichu.
Help Hogel track down his livestock.
</list>
<h1>Infiltration</h1>
The Sunriders are largely oblivious to infiltration, assuming the vast distances of travel needed to reach the settlements is protection enough. They also feel as though they have the capability to defeat enemies in battle even if their secrets are stolen. There is no secret for toughness.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 3
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Move through the horse pens under cover of darkness.
Dismiss Ile’s suspicions that you’re here under false pretenses.

Shoot a fleeing Sunrider sentry.
Battle a clutch of sentry drakes.

<h1>Warfare</h1>
Aside from a full strength Imperial force, the Sunriders possess the most dominant military in the land. Their ability to maneuver about the battlefield on horseback while pelting the enemy with arrows is greatly feared.
<b>Base Difficulty:</b> 6
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Out pace Sunrider rearguard to Dragon’s Tooth Fields.
Prepare horse traps in the Sunset Gorge.
Shore up weaknesses during advance into Sunrider line.
Survive winter march through the Long Wastes.

<h2>Special Units</h2>

<b>Conflict</b>	Skirmish	<b>Difficulty</b>	6

</missionentry>
In the vastness beyond the Long Wastes is the demesne of the ancient wyrm Pelakhar. Pelakhar, impossibly massive and covered with rusty brown scales, has grown bored with living. It seeks challenge and combat and bloodshed, but none will challenge it. The Sunriders know this, but even they are not so foolhardy as to challenge Pelakhar to battle.
Should the heroes of the Stronghold cross the vastness and subdue the beast, Pelakhar will grant its service in battle, craving excitement and conquest. It is an ancient and crafty foe, so such a task will not be easily achieved.
<h2>Sample Challenges</h2>
<list>
Keep group cohesion through the Miasma of Dragonfear.
Escape from the Moondrider slave camps.
Scale the outer face of the Dragon Monument.
Battle dusky sand mites.
</list>
<h2>Opposition</h2>
The great wyrm Pelakhar itches for a fight. If the heroes knock out Pelakhar, it agrees to claim the Stronghold’s banner in open warfare. Pelakhar has skills for units (Movement, Armor) as well as for characters. Ignore the unit skills during skirmish.

<stunt>Breath of Fire - </stunt>Draw a stress card to breathe fire. Make a ranged attack using Marksmanship and add +6 to the result. Pelakhar may target all characters in the same zone.
</stats>
Pelakhar will attack the heroes with a purposeful excitement, preferring its breath attack to biting and clawing as possible.
<h2>Resolution</h2>
If the heroes take Pelakhar out, it is bloody and subdued but not deceased. The heroes have woken something within the dragon and it pledges its aid in conquering the Stronghold’s foes.
Pelakhar may be used as a unit in warfare. Pelakhar can’t be bothered with fighting skirmishes, as it lusts after death on a grand scale. The spotlight player may control Pelakhar’s actions.
Furthermore, if Pelakhar is not used in warfare at least once a year, it grows bored of waiting and leaves the servitude of the Stronghold to find something more exciting.

</stats>
