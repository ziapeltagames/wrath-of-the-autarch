<chapter>Getting Started</chapter>
<book>Wrath of the Autarch</book> is an involved game, with many available tactical and strategic options. The rules shouldn’t be read all at once. Rather, it is best to get started by creating the Stronghold and start fleshing out the heroes. This chapter gets the ball rolling.
<book>WotA</book> supports up to five Stronghold players. One player, the Autarch player, functions as the opposition. Picking the Autarch player is the first task. Usually the Autarch player ends up being the player who owns the book. Although for this game, picking a player who isn’t afraid to heap misery and conflict onto the heroes also helps.
Hardship is the essence of drama, so having an opponent willing to push the other players into tough decisions makes for a more compelling game. Having a rotating Autarch player is another option, provided everyone is capable of pushing hard against the heroes while they’re in that role.
The first session is devoted to discussing the Stronghold and the group of heroes who will inhabit it. <book>WotA</book> purposefully strikes a balance between open ended world creation and fully fleshed out campaign setting. There are elements of the world which are not flexible, such as the five minor factions, the unexplored regions, the existence of the Autarch, as well as her plans to eventually conquer the Stronghold. Other background, such as why the Autarch is looking to conquer the Stronghold or particular details about each faction, is open for discussion.
For the first session print out a copy of the Stronghold sheet, the chronicle of trade, and ten character sheets. Also gather together some note cards.
<h1>The Campaign Arc</h1>
There are many different types of missions that stronghold players may choose from each season. During the course of the campaign it is likely that each type of mission will be undertaken at least once. However, the heroes from the Stronghold will be better at some sorts of missions than others. Before starting to think about the history of the Stronghold, it can be helpful to get a sense of what sorts of missions sound fun to all of the players. While it’s possible to adjust strategies over the course of the campaign, setting some expectations up front helps build consensus which makes the game more enjoyable for everyone.
There are five broad directions for strategy. It’s typically only possible to be really good at one or two of them. These five campaign frames mirror the five development trees for the Stronghold. It’s also possible to be mediocre in all of them, but that tends to be a far more difficult road. The five areas are as follows.
<list>
<b>Arcane—</b>The ability to wield magic. Magic is a more complementary strategy. It is flexible and powerful, but not without great risks. Going for a high arcane strategy is akin to swinging for the fences.
<b>Diplomacy—</b>Campaigns featuring diplomacy involve many interactions with the minor factions. The heroes will be building allies and convincing other leaders to join the cause. This is a slow building strategy, but basically unstoppable if it’s able to get going before the Autarch strikes.
<b>Infiltration—</b>Infiltration is the process of assassination, espionage, and sabotage to accomplish goals. This type of play features building maps and evading guards rather than full frontal attacks. Usually this strategy culminates with trying to assassinate the Autarch. Unlike diplomacy, infiltration doesn’t work as well for the long game, so speed is of the essence.
<b>Skirmish—</b>Most campaigns will involve some skirmishing, which takes the form of a small group of heroes battling monsters or bandits. Focusing on skirmish lets the Stronghold gain resources from undiscovered regions, which tend to be guarded by horrible beasts. Many quests for artifacts also need skirmish. The end goal of this focus is to separate the Autarch from the source of her magical energy.
<b>Warfare—</b>Finally, there is a strategy of raising troops and becoming a military juggernaut. These games will feature clashes of armies and lots of tactical maneuvering. Attacking the Empire directly isn’t easy, but with the right allies it becomes feasible.

<h2>Choosing Strategies</h2>
Take one of the note cards, and write down the five campaign frames. Each player chooses two of the five areas that sound appealing. Tally up the results to determine which two will be highlighted during the campaign, realizing that all of the areas will most likely see some playtime. This information will inform both the creation of the Stronghold and the heroes within the Stronghold. Have a discussion amongst the table about what everyone is looking for.
<h1>Stronghold Creation</h1>
The Stronghold is the central character in the campaign, so most of the first session is dedicated to its creation. Keep in mind the strategic directions voted on by the players while working through its creation. The first step is to create the five Stronghold aspects. Get out five note cards, and write the five themes for the Stronghold’s aspects: wrath, rule, belief, culture, and history.
<h2>Stronghold Aspects</h2>
The creation of the stronghold aspects helps create a trajectory for the campaign, as well as investing everyone in the unfolding story. Read out loud the brief description of the Empire from <chapref>The Empire</chapref> chapter later in this book. Also read the aspects that the Empire has. These have been worded to give the Autarch flavor and provide inspiration for the players, but not to make it impossible to add more detail. It’s okay to tweak the Empire aspects a little to fit the concept everyone has for the campaign.
Inspiration for the Stronghold aspects can come from the previous discussions regarding the focus of the campaign. Go over each aspect and start soliciting input from all of the players. If everyone is stuck, move on to the next aspect and come back later. Provided are questions to help spur creativity. Making these aspects should be a group activity. These are not just mechanical hooks, but facts about the world.

<h1>Hero Creation</h1>
Now it’s time to think about the heroes of the Stronghold. The players create a troupe of ten heroes to choose from, but the heroes don’t need to be fully fleshed out at the start of the campaign. It is helpful to think about the composition of the heroes at a high level. How do they fit into the Stronghold’s goals and the campaign arc? Place two blank note cards below each of the five Stronghold aspects that were created in the previous step. These note cards will be used to start sketching out the hero concepts.
<h2>Peak Skill</h2>
The easiest place to start is to write down peak skills for the heroes on each of the note cards. As described further in the <chapref>Characters</chapref> chapter, the peak skill is the highest rated skill a character has (it starts at +4). Think back to the discussion of the campaign arc. It’s probably wise to have four or five heroes that are well adapted to one sort of conflict. The types of skills that are best suited to each conflict are as follows.
<list>
<b>Diplomacy—</b>Rapport, Society, Wits
<b>Infiltration—</b>Stealth, Deceive, Thievery, Athletics
<b>Skirmish—</b>Fighting or Marksmanship, Survival, Athletics
<b>Warfare—</b>Tactics, Command, Engineering
</list>
Magic is used for any of these conflicts. Characters relying on magic start out relatively weak, but through developments can become very powerful. For heroes utilizing magic, select Lore as the peak skill (also take a high Channeling).
Write down the peak skills on the note cards, making sure to have enough characters for each type of desired strategy. Characters can have a mix of abilities, but the peak skill goes a long way in determining what they’re best at.

<h2>Core Concept</h2>
Now start thinking of the core concept for each hero. Use the Stronghold aspects attached to the note card for inspiration. For example, if the hero is next to the Stronghold’s rule aspect, they might have had a key role in the formation of the system of rule. Maybe they’re a noble or a king or an ambassador of some sort? How do they fit in with the rulings of the Stronghold? The goal here is to come up with a concise phrase that describes the hero, such as <aspect>World Weary Diplomat</aspect>. This short phrase will become the hero’s core concept aspect (see the <chapref>Characters</chapref> chapter for more information).
Do this for all ten heroes. When finished, there should be two heroes related in some way to each of the Stronghold’s five aspects. The heroes should have a peak skill and a core concept.
<h2>Start Sketchy</h2>
When a hero has a peak skill and a core concept aspect, you’re ready to use them in a mission. The hero gets additional skills and aspects, as well as a starting stunt, but these can be filled in later. That said - it’s not too hard to fill out the rest of the skills and pick two stunts. See the <chapref>Characters</chapref> chapter for more details.
Filling in the rest of the aspects is sometimes trickier. Don’t force it. It’s fine to start with only a rough idea of what the character is all about. Seeing what happens during play is usually the best catalyst for figuring out what really makes a hero tick. When inspiration strikes, fill in more aspects. Heroes can also change aspects over the course of the campaign, so nothing is locked in stone. The most important thing early on is to get a rough grasp on the overall composition of heroes that are available.
Print out character sheets from the back of the book, and fill in the peak skill as well as the Core Concept for each hero.
<h1>Finishing Touches</h1>
Fill in the five aspects on the Stronghold sheet. Collectively, think of a name for the Stronghold, and fill that in as well. The stability for the Stronghold starts at 0. Mark that in.
<h2>Choose Alliances</h2>
On the chronicle of trade are entries for all the minor factions. Each faction has a disposition entry. Dispositions can be positive or negative. The more positive, the better the relation, with a disposition of +5 or higher indicating a very solid alliance, and -5 or lower indicating fairly strong hatred. One minor faction starts with a disposition of +3, another with a disposition of +2, and a third with a disposition of +1. The rest start at 0. Fill in the checkboxes with current dispositions.
It is good to pick allies based on the focus of the Stronghold. Each minor faction has an area of expertise as, and this can help when improving the Stronghold.
<list>
<b>Burgan Vale—</b>Arcane
<b>Crescent Hold—</b>Skirmish
<b>Gravewood—</b>Infiltration
<b>Lily Manor—</b>Diplomacy
<b>Sunriders—</b>Warfare
</list>
<figure>
Show the chronicle of trade, with a blown up section that has the faction dispositions filled in?
</figure>
<h2>Starting Regions</h2>
The Stronghold starts with three regions from which to gain resources. These are already default region names on the Stronghold sheet. If desired, write over the names with names that better reflect the culture of your Stronghold.
<h2>Starting Units</h2>
The Stronghold begins with ten militia units. Note this under the Units section of the Stronghold sheet.
<h2>Choose First Mission</h2>
Once the Stronghold sheet is filled out, and the troupe of ten heroes has been assembled, the Stronghold players should decide choose their first mission. In a typical session, choosing the next mission happens at the end. This is guided by the spotlight player. The first session doesn’t have a spotlight player, so the Stronghold players should try to reach consensus as much as possible. If there is no agreement, the Stronghold players should vote, with ties broken by the Autarch player.
A very common opening mission is to conquer one of the easier unexplored regions, such as North Oaks, Green Vale, or Sightrock. This provides an early boost of resources while there are no threats to deal with.
Using alliance to improve disposition with a faction is also a good first option. The faction with a +2 disposition makes a particularly appealing target option, since going up to +3 gives much better trade results. Factions with a high difficulty for diplomacy missions (such as Lily Manor) may be too difficult early on.
Sabotage isn’t a bad option to gain leverage on a faction early, although it is more effective with improved infiltration developments. Warfare isn’t practical early in the campaign.
<h2>For the First Mission</h2>
Read the <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> chapter, the <chapref>Challenge Phase</chapref> chapter, as well as the appropriate conflict chapter prior to playing the first mission.
Good luck and make your seasons count!
