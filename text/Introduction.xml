        <chapter>Introduction</chapter> 
        <p1>Even during a time of war, the Autarch watches your fledgling society with a keen eye toward teaching you a painful lesson. It was years ago that you gathered the people up from under her nose and traveled beyond the dark mountains toward the east, looking to start a new life. Yet old grudges die hard, and catching the cloaked Freetrader within your village confirmed your worst fears; when the war is over, the Autarch will begin the struggle against you in earnest.</p1> 
        <p1>And there is no longer any question of <i>if</i> the Autarch will conquer the Plainsmen. It is only a question of when. Perhaps a few years yet before the threats will begin, before her thirst for expansion brings her beyond the mountains toward your Stronghold, but no more than that. You have a dearth of time to prepare for the Autarch’s wrath. Will you use that time to build up a military force to stop her? Use diplomacy and convince the scattered factions around you to unite for a common cause? Or will you ignore the great risks, and harness the power of the arcane arts? What will you sacrifice for independence?</p1> 
        <h1>The Campaign</h1> 
        <p1>The <book>Wrath of the Autarch (WotA)</book> is a kingdom building roleplaying game built upon the <book>Fate Core</book> game engine. This system has been popularized and interpreted by games like <book>Spirit of the Century</book>, <book>Dresden Files</book>, <book>Legends of Anglerre</book>, and <book>Diaspora</book>. The roleplaying part of the game involves friends getting together and telling stories about a fantastical realm. The central character of these stories is the <term>Stronghold</term>, a society of people struggling to survive in the shadow of The Empire of the Autarch, a powerful nation bent on their destruction. The Stronghold will hopefully grow over many seasons into a powerful force capable of withstanding the onslaught of the Autarch, but it will require good strategy and a little luck.</p1> 
        <p1>More than just telling stories, though, <book>WotA</book> is also a game. The players strategize and plan the best course of action to thwart the Autarch. <book>WotA</book> is played over a series of sessions, each taking three or so hours of time. These sessions form a campaign, which will end when the Stronghold has either thwarted the Autarch, or succumbed to her wrath.</p1> 
        <p1>During a session, most of the players take on the roles of characters trying to accomplish a <term>mission</term> for the greater glory of the Stronghold. Another player takes on the role of all of the adversaries, including the actions and strategies of the Autarch. <book>WotA</book> is a competitive game, with the Autarch player trying to oversee the collapse of the Stronghold. Many of the responsibilities of creating the story and setting details are shared by all the players.</p1> 
        <p1>Missions involve many different activites, such as exploring strange new regions to find resources, engaging in diplomacy with other minor <term>factions</term> for purposes of trade and friendship, infiltrating or assassinating targets, and even clashing with the forces of the Autarch on the field of battle. Only one mission may be attempted for each season of the campaign, so it is important to prioritize which missions are the most pressing.</p1> 
        <p1>Unlike most tabletop roleplaying games, players do not play the role of only one character for the duration of the campaign. Instead, a pool of up to ten important <term>heroes</term> for the Stronghold are created during the campaign. At the beginning of each session of play, each player chooses (or creates) a character from this pool, based on the hero’s suitability for the mission at hand. For instance, if the mission involves killing an ogre that is stealing cattle, choosing characters more suitable for combat or tracking would be wise. Managing these heroes is an important part of the game, as they are not easily recovered if something unfortunate occurs. If enough heroes are killed or taken out of action for lengthy periods of time, it may become difficult to successfully complete missions and hold off the Autarch.</p1> 
        <p1>Although the heroes can gain skill and evolve during a mission, of greater importance is the effect each mission has on the Stronghold. The impact a mission will have on the Stronghold is known before it is attempted, both the rewards for success and the penalties for failure. Ultimately, there are only so many significant efforts which can be accomplished during a year, and each mission will need to be prioritized between the immediate needs of the Stronghold and the players&apos; long term strategic vision.</p1>   
        <h2>Characters</h2> 
        <p1>Characters in WotA are described by five primary facets; <term>aspects</term>, <term>skills</term>, <term>stunts</term>, <term>stress</term>, and <term>consequences</term>. Aspects are arguably the most important part of any Fate game. These are short descriptive phrases which give both color and mechanical weight to characters, relationships, factions, regions, and scenes. For instance, <aspect>Towering Swordsmith</aspect> and <aspect>Quick to Anger</aspect> could be aspects associated with a character. Aspects are described in more detail in the Fate chapter, and in even greater detail in the <book>Fate Core</book> rules.</p1> 
        <p1>Skills are broad areas of capability which help flesh out what a character is good at. Stunts are associated with skills and are abilities that go above and beyond what the common person is capable of.</p1> 
        <p1>Stress and consequences reflect different forms of hardships the character is experiencing. There are two main stress tracks, <term>mental</term> and <term>physical</term>. Mental stress could range from psychological trauma to lack of dedication for the mission at hand. Physical stress tends to represent exhaustion and strain. There are consequences (represented as aspects) associated with these stress tracks. While stress is very transient, consequences could be longer lasting: more harmful psychological issues or raw physical trauma. The Fate chapter covers this in more detail.</p1> 
        <h2>The Stronghold</h2> 
        <p1>The Stronghold is the central character in the game. The term <i>Stronghold</i> is used as a generic way to refer to the society which all of the heroes will inhabit (the players will come up with a specific and evocative name for their particular Stronghold). During the initial session of the game, more details about the Stronghold will be fleshed out. Why was the Stronghold founded? What sort of grudge exists between the Autarch and the Stronghold? What are the values of the people within the Stronghold?</p1> 
        <p1>The Stronghold has a few attributes that are tracked throughout the campaign. There are only a few attributes for the Stronghold: <term>stability</term>, <term>population</term>, and <term>dispositions</term> with other factions. These are all numeric values. Stability describes the overall health of the Stronghold. If stability decreases too far, the Stronghold will collapse and the players will fail to stop the Autarch. Population is an abstract value measuring the number of people living under the Stronghold’s banner. Dispositions are tracked between the Stronghold and the other factions in the game, and represent a level of allegiance.</p1> 
        <p1>The Stronghold also has <term>developments</term> and <term>regions</term>. Developments are improved capabilities for the Stronghold. They are similar to stunts for characters, although they affect all the heroes in the Stronghold. For instance, a mage tower provides all the heroes access to certain powerful magics. Regions are large areas of land, which provide resources with which to trade or build developments. The resources in the game are <term>food</term>, <term>timber</term>, <term>ore</term>, <term>mana</term>, and <term>luxuries</term>.</p1>  
        <h1>The Realm</h1> 
        <p1>The setting for Wrath of the Autarch takes place in a medieval fantasy world known as the Realm. Besides the Empire of the Autarch, there are five minor factions which play an important part in determining if the Autarch is successful. Each faction has different strengths and weaknesses, and becoming allies with a complementary faction is important. Although each faction has a few key details to help everyone get into the setting, this isn't a worldbook with a fully fleshed out history. The players will collaborate every session to fill in the skeleton and make the world their own.</p1> 
        <h2>Geography</h2> 
        <p1>There is no set world map or geography. The factions, like the Stronghold, also have regions, although the exact location of regions is left ambiguous. There are also neutral regions, each with different sorts of goods and features, which the Stronghold may be able to explore and settle.</p1> 
        <h2>The Land is Alive</h2> 
        <p1>Magic in the Realm is a primeval force which links the land and the people together. The raw substrate is referred to as mana, and is harnessed by channelers, people and creatures trained in both detecting and harnessing it. Mana is present everywhere, but in some regions, old and mysterious places in the Realm, it exists in a high enough concentration that it can be used to create powerful effects. Magic is powerful, but also chaotic and dangerous, potentially <term>backlashing</term> and blighting the land.</p1> 
        <h2>The Autarch</h2> 
        <p1>Perhaps not surprisingly, the Autarch is an important figure in the game. She is a sorcerer of great power and an incredibly shrewd leader. The Autarch rules over a sprawling empire, known internally as the Independent Free Guilds, whose populace are referred to as Freetraders. Outsiders refer to their society as the Empire.</p1>
        <p1>At the start of the campaign, the players work together to come up with motivation for the conflict between the Autarch and the Stronghold. The Empire may just pursue relentless expansionism, or there could be a more personal reason. Perhaps the heroes of the Stronghold are military defectors or political dissidents. For some reason, though, there is a great threat from the Autarch which the Stronghold will need to deal with. Initially, the Autarch is fighting a battle against a primitive but numerous people known as the Plainsmen, which provides the Stronghold a few years of relative calm to build up before the Autarch can attack in earnest.</p1>  
        <p1>The Autarch also has stability and population attributes like the Stronghold, and they function in much the same way. The focus of the entire campaign is to reduce the Autarch's stability to zero. The Autarch player doesn't harvest resources and build developments in the same way as the Stronghold, however. Instead, a few different <term>threat pools</term> are used to track offensive and defensive capability. These threat pools grow each season, and allow the Autarch player to formulate their own strategy to stop the Stronghold.</p1>
        <h2>Minor Factions</h2> 
        <p1>Minor factions also have the same key attributes (stability and population), developments, and regions that the Autarch and Stronghold have. For the minor factions, these capabilities tend to be very static and unchanging over the campaign. Each minor faction has a trade chart which lists various imports and exports. Trade relations with other factions may form an important part of the long term strategy of the Stronghold. Each faction has their own chapter which describes in more detail the important leaders and abilities they possess. Briefly, the factions are described here:</p1>
        <ul>
            <l1>
                <b>Burgan Vale: </b>The people of the Vale live in a balance with the land, taking only what they need. Some of the most powerful wizards in the Realm reside here.
            </l1>
            <l1>
                <b>Crescent Hold: </b>Amongst the cliffs of the Crescent Hold are massive fortresses made of stone and steel. The culture of Crescent Hold is very stratified, each citizen understands their role in getting and using ore from the mines below.
            </l1>
            <l1>
                <b>Lily Manor: </b>A cosmopolitan trade hub, the royals within Lily Manor are experts at getting maximum value from the exquisite fineries they have on offer. All manner of pleasures and goods are on offer in their marble pleasure domes.
            </l1>
            <l1>
                <b>Gravewood: </b>The people of Gravewood are withdrawn and isolated from the world. They carve out a difficult life in a dangerous part of the Realm that not many care to visit. Their independence is guarded both by isolation as well as by learning and leveraging secrets from other factions.
            </l1>
            <l1>
                <b>The Sunriders: </b>The Sunriders are loosely assembled martial clans that roam the land on great golden destriers from whence their name comes. The Sunriders guard and protect large swathes of farmland which they use for both feeding the population and trading for mana.
            </l1>                        
        </ul>
        <h1>Missions</h1> 
        <p1>Each season the players from the Stronghold choose which mission to undertake. There are eight types of missions in WotA. Each type of mission has different effects on the Stronghold and possibly other factions in the Realm. The mission types are:</p1> 
        <ul> 
            <l1>
                <b>Exploration: </b>The heroes adventure to neutral regions, exploring them to find much needed resources. Exploration could involve fighting off beasts or negotiating with native peoples. There are ten neutral regions that the Stronghold could claim.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Trade: </b>Trade allows for developing trade agreements with another faction. This is an important part of the strategy in WotA, covering your weaknesses by forming favorable alliances with other factions in the Realm. Trade is also a way to improve relations with the faction, which improves the disposition score.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Conquest: </b>Conquest is the clash of armies. Frequently this will occur against the forces of the Autarch, although it is possible to use Conquest missions to thwart other factions and plunder their resources.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Espionage: </b>The secrets learned through Espionage allow the Stronghold to steal secrets that make building some developments much easier. Espionage can also reveal the plans of the Autarch, which greatly helps strategic planning.
            </l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Sabotage: </b>Sabotage hobbles the effectiveness of a faction's developments, weakening them against other sorts of missions. Sabotage can also directly affect stability.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Assassination: </b>Murdering a faction's leader is a grim but possibly effective way to render them ineffective against certain mission types. Assassinating the Autarch is another way to win the game.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Quest: </b>Quests are expeditions to retrieve powerful relics and artifacts. These are frequently very difficult missions, but the rewards can be substantial. Rumors of these artifacts must first be found, however, through alliance with other minor factions.</l1> 
            <l1>
                <b>Threat: </b>Threats are problems that can occur in regions and with other factions. Threats are determined either by chance (for threats occurring in regions or with minor factions) or by the Autarch player (for threats from the Autarch, which grow in difficulty over time). They can be ignored, but there will be consequences for the Stronghold.</l1> 
        </ul>  
        <h2>Mission Structure</h2> 
        <p1>Missions are composed of two distinct modes of play, a <term>challenge phase</term> followed by a <term>conflict</term>. During the challenge phase, the players are confronted by tasks and hardships referred to as <term>challenges</term> which potentially give characters stress. It is also a time for players to use certain stunts and skills proactively, in order to give the heroes advantages later on in the mission. The challenge phase is fast moving and relies on the creativity of all the players to add to the story.</p1> 
        <p1>After the narrative phase comes the conflict, a set of tactical rules designed around a specific theme. The type of conflict depends on the current mission. Where the challenges are very simple and open for any situation, the conflicts provide a tactical framework that allows for more strategy during play. Although each conflict has a different flavor, they're organized around similar rules and principles to make the game more cohesive. The conflict types are:</p1> 
        <ul>
            <l1>
                <b>Diplomacy: </b>Rules for persuading influential members of other factions to agree to a deal with the Stronghold.</l1>
            <l1> 
                <b>Infiltration: </b>Conducting activities in stealth and secret against a physical target.</l1>
            <l1> 
                <b>Skirmish: </b>Tactical combat involving the heroes and small numbers of opponents.</l1>
            <l1> 
                <b>Warfare: </b>Large scale military action involving the units of the Stronghold opposed by other factions.</l1>
        </ul> 
        <h1>How to Proceed</h1> 
        <p1>It is neither necessary, nor even wise, to read the entire book before playing. The most important pieces of information are placed in the first few chapters. The <chapref>Fate</chapref>, <chapref>Missions</chapref>, and <chapref>Challenge Phase</chapref> chapters are the most important in terms of key rules. Everything is built from these concepts. The <chapref>First Spring</chapref> chapter includes information on the first session and how to start playing. Read these three chapters before attempting play. The rest of the book should be read as needed over the course of the campaign.</p1>   
        <h1>Designer’s Notes</h1> 
        <p1>Since this is a beta version of the rules, many chapters end with designer’s notes. These notes may eventually be incorporated into the final rules in some fashion, or left out. But they are a way to help convey random thoughts and ideas which would clutter up the main rules text.</p1> 
        <p1>This game arose in a rather untoward fashion according to the conventional game design wisdom. It began as the quintessential Fantasy Heartbreaker. D&amp;D is so awesome, except for this one thing! And this other thing! Be that as it may, I began to have ideas about game design that seemed to be slowly evolving past simple issues with D&amp;D. They also weren’t quite addressed to my satisfaction in any game system I have encountered, despite a good deal of looking around.</p1> 
        <p1>My main interest is to explore a strategic kingdom building background to a fantasy roleplaying game. This has been done, of course, in games like <book>Birthright</book>, <book>Pendragon</book>, <book>Reign</book>, <book>Houses of the Blooded</book>, <book>Song of Ice and Fire</book>, <book>Burning Empires</book>, not to mention more recent supplements for games like 3E and <book>Pathfinder</book> (Kingmaker Campaign).</p1> 
        <p1>Although each of these games had elements I was interested in, none of them quite captured what I was hoping for. <book>Houses of the Blooded</book>, a game I actually read later in the design process, is probably the closest to what I was looking for, since it embraces the strategic vision I was interested in. But, there are a few unique elements I’m most interested in exploring under a single game system. They are:</p1> 
        <ul> 
            <l1>
                <b>Troupe style play</b>
            </l1> 
            <l2>Rather than each player restricting themselves to a single character, a group of characters is used, and different characters selected for the mission at hand.</l2> 
            <l2>One benefit to this approach is that players usually have a character which is appropriate to the type of scene they’re in. No need to explain away taking a diplomat into a dungeon.</l2>
            <l2>Another aspect of having the troupe style play is that heroes themselves become a resource. If enough of them are injured or not able to function, then certain types of missions become very difficult. This makes for interesting strategic choices.</l2>
            <l2>The downside is that it can be difficult switching characters too often. In practice, since there is a limited pool of characters, a player will generally rotate between only a few characters.</l2> 
            <l1>
                <b>Well defined missions</b>
            </l1> 
            <l2>Another key part of the design is the use of missions with very transparent rewards and consequences.</l2> 
            <l2>A high level of transparency makes it easier to strategize which activities most naturally align with the vision of the Stronghold.</l2> 
            <l2>Setting the stakes of the missions ahead of time also can help increase tension during the mission.</l2> 
            <l2>Finally, restricting missions to a set of pre-defined types makes it possible to focus play towards a very specific task. Sometimes players can lose focus of their goal, possibly over-analyzing options. Setting the nature of the mission beforehand makes this less likely, as the task is openly discussed by both the players and the GM.</l2> 
            <l2>In a kingdom building game, some sort of high level structure seems necessary so that the temporal pacing makes sense. By having short constrained missions, which are tied to a season of time, the campaign is able to progress at a reasonable rate, without getting bogged down in too much minutiae.</l2> 
            <l2>The missions themselves are also constrained in terms of how different scenes fit together. This is done for pacing reasons, so that a particular mission fits into a reasonable length of time. It also allows for different mechanical elements (like mini-games) to fit into a session of play.</l2> 
            <l1>
                <b>A marriage of mechanics and setting</b>
            </l1> 
            <l2>I think it makes for better play if mechanics are adapted as closely as possible to the setting. There are certainly generic mechanics that are highly useful, as evidenced by the use of Fate in this game, but certain mechanics bring about different play styles and need to be adapted to the target genre. While generic toolkits are sometimes fun, it’s usually not trivial getting them to fit into a setting. I wanted to do as much of that heavy lifting as possible.</l2>
            <l2>As such, a fantasy kingdom building game is probably best built from the ground up as a cohesive whole. I’m fairly skeptical of rule sets which attempt to tack on the mechanics of kingdom building to a framework which was never designed to support maintaining a kingdom. In such a game, the kingdom becomes simply a possession that a character has, rather than the focus of the game.</l2> 
            <l2>I think this should be extended to the setting. There are plenty of fantasy RPGs out there which throw all the standard tropes into a box and let the GM and players sort it out. That’s all well and good, but I’m more interested in giving the GM a world which is partially fleshed out, since it becomes much easier to control how the setting and the mechanics interact. Very frequently rules have implicit settings (such as D&amp;D) – but it’s probably better to make the setting explicit to clarify exactly what sort of game works with the rules.</l2> 
            <l2>Finally, having a better defined setting makes it easier for GMs to construct missions quickly. Part of my goal with this game is to lower preparation time, without sacrificing interesting tactical options. This is possible only be essentially building the rules around a specific setting. While this is certainly not a simple game, it also isn’t a high prep game. These three principles have guided the design process. Certainly games exist which embrace some of these design goals. The three that are closest are probably: Houses of the Blooded, which does a great job of putting the kingdom at the forefront, with just the right amount of fiddliness, Diaspora, which explores the idea of using mini-games as tactically rich resolution systems, as well as being a Fate game, and finally Burning Empires, which uses scene currency very effectively. I’m sure those excellent games have influenced what I’ve tried to do with WotA. Editorial note: Specific skills, stunts, mission types, mini-games, and resources are all capitalized. Every other game specific term is left lower case. All game specific terms are bolded the first time they are used. Chapter and section titles are capitalized and italicized when they are used.</l2>
